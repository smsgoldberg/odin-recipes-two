      <li>2 tablespoons chili sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place paneer in a bowl and add enough cornstarch
          to coat; mix well. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat; fry paneer
        until golden brown; 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer
        paneer to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving oil in 
        the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine garlic and ginger in the hot oil; add onion, green
        chili peppers, and bell pepper. Cook and stir until vegetables
        are golden brown; about 5 minutes. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix soy sauce, chili sauce, tomato sauce, sugar, salt, and 
        remaining constarch into onion mixture, stirring in water 
        if mixture is too thick. Add paneer; cook and stir until
        gravy is thickened; 2 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from
        heat and garnish chili with cilantro and green onions.
      </li>
    </ol>
  <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
  <ul>
     <li>Use tofu instead of paneer for a vegan twist!</li>
     <li>You can make a thick batter of cornstarch using 
        water and coat paneer pieces with it, if desired.
     </li>
  </ul>
