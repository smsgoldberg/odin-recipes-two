        <li>Juice of one lemon</li>
        <li>10 ounces spinach fettucine</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Garnishes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>grated Parigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>fennel fronds</li>
        <li>chili pepper oil (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Put a large pot of well-salted water
            on to boil. Heat the olive oil in a 
            large frying pan over low heat. Add the 
            onion and cook gently for 5 minutes, or
            until the onions are beginning to soften.
        </li>
        <li>Turn up the heat to medium, add the sliced
            fennel, and saute gently for an additional 
            6 to 8 minutes, or until the fennel is tender
            and slightly caramelized. Add the garlic and 
            red pepper flakes and continue to cook, stirring
            frequently, for another minute or two. Turn off 
            the heat.
        </li>
        <li>When the fennel is almost cooked, add the pasta
            to the pan of boiling water and cook until al dente,
            adding the kale to the pasta pot about 2 to 3 
            minutes before the pasta is done cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Drain the pasta (reserving 1/2 cup of the starchy
            cooking water) and greens thoroughly and toss with
            the onion and fennel mixture in the pan -- adding
            pasta water if necessary. Add the lemon juice, 
            season with salt and pepper, and serve immediately.
        </li>
        <li>Drizzle each serving with chili oil, fennel fronds,
            and lots of grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>
