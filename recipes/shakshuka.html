        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 small carrot, finely grated</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>24 oz jar tomato sauce or your favorite
                pasta sauce
            </li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>14-oz can white beans</li>
            <li>5-6 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves, diced</li>

            <p>You'll also need a large 12-inch skillet with
               a lid or an onion-safe skillet. A cast-iron or a
               non-stick skillet will both work fine!
            </p>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a large skillet. Add the olive oil, 
                    diced onion, grated carrot, and stir fry 
                    for 5 minutes over medium heat. 
                </li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic, paprika, ground
                    coriander, and ground cumin. Stir fry 
                    for 2 minutes, to combine the spices 
                    with the carrot mixture.
                </li>
                <li>Add the jarred tomato sauce. Optional,
                    if you want a thinner sauce: rinse the 
                    jar with 1/2 cup water and stir the water
                    into the sauce with the skillet. You can 
                    always add the water latern if you see the
                    sauce is getting too thick for your liking.
                </li>
                <li>Add the drained white beans. Bring to a 
                    gentle boil, then lower the heat and allow
                    to simmer for 5 minutes. Carefully taste the
                    sauce and stir in salt and pepper, if needed.
                </li>
                <li>Use a spoon or spatula to make 4-6 indentations
                    in the skillet. Carefully crack an egg into each
                    indentation. Use a spoon to carefully push some 
                    of the tomato sauce around the egg whites so they
                    don't spread much. Season with salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>Cover with a lid, and allow to simmer for 5-10 
                    minutes, or until the egg is cooked to your liking.
                    Remove from heat and sprinkle with crumbled feta and
                    fresh parsley. Serve warm. 
                </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
